This is the fourth Assignment for CSL 201. The last date for submission is Wednesday, October 24, 2012 
by midnight.

The description of the assignment and input-output formats are given in the handout "Assignment3" on
moodle.

We are giving five input test files in0, in1, in2, in3, in4 in the tar archive ``input-assgn4.tar.gz". 
The description of each test case along with the correct output is given in the file ``test_cases_skip_list".

Please EXACTLY follow the instructions given below, as your programs may be checked by a shell script.

HOW TO SUBMIT
-------------

1. The C++ program should be named "skiplist.cpp". 

2. If your first name is X and last name is Y, make a directory "X_Y_HW4" and copy the above
   file to that directory.

3. You will submit a tar archive of directory X_Y_HW4 on moodle. A tar archive performs the same
   function as WinZip on windows. It allows you to compress several files into a single 
   file. To create a .tar archive of all your assignment programs, type the following command :

   tar cvzf X_Y_HW4.tar.gz X_Y_HW4/

   This command directs the computer to make a single tar archive with name "X_Y_HW4.tar.gz"
   of all files in the directory X_Y_HW4. Note that you have to run this command in the parent
   directory of X_Y_HW4.

   Once the file "X_Y_HW4.tar.gz" is created, you can check its contents (i.e., the names of files
   it contains) by the following command :

   tar tzf X_Y_HW4.tar.gz

3. Login into moodle and click on the link "Submit Assignment4" (the link just below the link you used
   to download this file).  Next upload the file "X_Y_HW4.tar.gz" to moodle by using the link at the bottom of 
   the page. Your assignment submission is complete.

4. We will download your submission from moodle, compile and run the programs on test
   cases using a shell script and give you marks for the assignment. Moodle will show the marks obtained by you 
   on the assignment after the grading is complete.

IMPORTANT REMARKS
-----------------
0. Your program should not be distributed over multiple files. As asked above, please submit a single file
   named "skiplist.cpp".

1. Your program should be WRITTEN IN C++. You should not use any other programming 
   language including Java.

2. If your program does not work on even the simplest examples, you should expect no more than 30% marks.
   The same holds if your program gives compilation errors. The total score will depend roughly on the number 
   of test cases for which your algorithm gives the correct answer.

3. Your program should read input in the input format given in the problem statement. Avoid devising your
   own input formats. These are all right for initial coding, but your submission should accept input
   in the format given in the problem statement. 

4. It is your responsibility that your programs compile and run on the Linux machines in the Computer Lab. This
   is where your programs will be compiled and tested. If you used Windows/Turbo C++ for coding, you should test 
   your programs on the Linux machines in the lab before submission. No complaints in this regard will be 
   entertained.
